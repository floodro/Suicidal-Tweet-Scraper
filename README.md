# SENTINEL - A Suicidal Tweet Analyzer using Sentiment Analysis
This is one of my projects made in December 2020, a suicidal tweet scraper that gets tweets based on a list of words related to suicide like "end me", "i want to die", etc. 

This script also implements Sentiment Analysis via a Python module named TextBlob to find the subjectivity and polarity (positivity or negativity) of the tweets gathered.
